# My very first react application ðŸ˜ƒ

My backend code is written using Express.js and is used to handle blog posts via HTTP requests. I have configured endpoints to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The GET handler allows me to fetch all blog posts from my MongoDB database. The POST request enables me to create and add new blog posts. The PUT request facilitates the update of existing posts, while the DELETE request allows me to remove specific posts from the database. Additionally, I have implemented CORS middleware to handle cross-origin requests. The server listens on a specified port, and I can customize it using environment variables. Through this code, I can effectively manage blog content and interact with my MongoDB database. Furthermore, I have deployed my backend code on Heroku, and it is now connected to my frontend hosted on Netlify.
